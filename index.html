<h1> Hello World! </h1>
<p>My Blog: file:///C:/Users/jdisa/Desktop/blog.html</p>
<p> My name is Justin Disalvo. <br>
I'm a third year transfer student from Umpqua Community College and I'm studying Computer Science. <br>
I have very little experiance with HTML, so I'd say 2/10. <br>
What I hope to learn: <ul> 
<li>how to create web pages</li>
<li>learn new programming languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li></ul> <br>
I have signed up for Piazza even though I don't understand what it is. <br>
Fun Fact: My favorite animal is a killer whale and favorite domestic animal are dogs. <br>
