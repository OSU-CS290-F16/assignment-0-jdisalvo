<p>I had a few difficulties completing this assignment. First, I couldn't figure out where to start. It was difficult for me to figure out how to use Github even with the tutorials. Once I figured it out I was unsure what exactly the assignment wanted unitl I figured out that I had to edit the file that was provited.<br>
Even though this assignment was frusterating, I still learned a lot about basic html and how to set up an html file. I used the internet to look up how to use sertain tags I needed for my page. I used w3schools.com mostly.<br><br>
